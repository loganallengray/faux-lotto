# Faux Lotto

## Introduction

What is Faux Lotto? It's a gambling site that doesn't use real money, so there is zero risk, but no reward either. 

## Purpose and Motivation

I wanted to give people who physically couldn't or didn't want to gamble with real money a site where they could play a few gambling games.  

## How to Use

Once downloaded, you can log in to an already existing account or register a new one.

If you've just made your account, you will have zero funds. To add funds, go to the Funds page and fill out the form to add fake currency to your account.

After that, you can go to the Games page and start gambling. You can choose from three games, Coin Flip, Horse Race, and Blackjack. To play each you specify an amount, click the green button, and the game will start.

Once you've played a few games, you can go to your Profile to view all of your previously played games, and some statistics tied to your account.

## Development

Faux Lotto was developed with React. 

## How to Install

Download the repository, serve the database.json file ("json-server -p 8088 database.json"), and then serve the entire folder ("npm start").

## Difficulties

Programming the games was definitely the biggest challenge of this project. I'm proud that I got them to work properly, though.
